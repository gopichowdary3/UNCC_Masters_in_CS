two films so will have to use different one for an example have you seen tampopo there is scene there where couple kiss to pass raw egg back and forth until it breaks or if you haven seen that you ve

example is not porn the scene you mention is erotic certainly though in no way pornographic but wouldn even think about calling it an erotic film much less porn that would be like calling king lear

decided that since madame aema was made only to capitalize on the nudity and sexual activity it fits in the project ppong is literary adaptation of some artistic quality and basically sex farce still little uncomfortable with the subjectivity of this decision but so it goes both get the erotic film category though am the only one who has difficulty with the pornography label it does seem bit of
