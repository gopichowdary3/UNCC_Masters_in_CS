beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didnt care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humorbut about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at

nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitta during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare

late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her casethere are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston the henry luce clone thatchers memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kanes story this method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incidentthis is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about a legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators they are garners right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henrytypical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes toms confrontation with the union in a major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the unions headquarters killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure blackim not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kanes success few films do including all of orson welles other films but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought homewhen they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at a cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys hersimilarly tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be eves son by toms son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himselfthe film is not a total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of

going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd its not that shocking its not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us

other hand genesis cerdas sequel to aftermath now available as a double feature released by unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director cerda really

holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling

never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasnt

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
