We thought it was a feel good movie. My grandson said it was AMAZING!,positive
"If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it.",positive
"I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.<br /><br />As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.",negative
"I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.",positive
This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film.,negative
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable",negative
Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.,negative
"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. ""How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy""? Gary Busey is know for his ""B"" movies, but this is a sure ""W"" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is ""confused"" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough",negative
i listened to stupid anti feminists and didnt see the movie when i shouldve. i cried so many times and crying still rn in the theater parking lot because it is such a raw and thrilling experience that i am still reeling from. terrible press from wildes actions overshadowed and left a BAD taste in everyones mouths about this movie when we should be praising it. ended perfectly.,positive
Slow start but worth the wait! Very suspenseful and great visuals! Pugh deserves an Oscar for her performance!,positive
"Good acting, interesting premise and held my attention. But ultimately disappointing. 25% longer than required, resulting in much repetition. Essentially, a theme in search of a plot.",negative
Slow start but worth the wait! Very suspenseful and great visuals! Pugh deserves an Oscar for her performance!,positive
"I didn't know what it was about so the plot was a cool surprise. This was a modern take on the classic vampire genre so I enjoyed it but this doesn't make the movie good. It was below average, the acting was bad.",negative
I thought this movie was gonna be more similar to ready or not. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was even better.,positive
Movie was very confusing and kind of boring at times,negative
"This movie was so bad. Worst movie i've ever seen. They rushed into thing, like common y'all were fucking on the 3rd day and making out on the 2nd day, like you guys just met. The ending was bad it seemed like a short film on youtube. The guy needs to stay in descendants. They only thing I liked was the dresses she wore but other than that it was so bad.",negative
"Lyle Lyle Crocodile"" is an outstanding comedy and musical! Despite being less audience when I saw it, it was still enjoyable to watch with family. It is a creative and fun film, who would think of a crocodile singing, it's amazing!",positive
It’s probably one of the best movies of the year. Such a cute movie you will love all of the entertainment. The animation is incredible. Just a feel good movie. Anybody will love it adults or children.,positive
"Lyle unfortunately didn't keep my kids interested it started ok but as the movie goes,it becomes hard to watch and I wish there was more Javier Barden in it. Going to the movies it's so expensive nowadays ,and I don't think it was worth the trip. I actually feel ripped off. The songs in the movie are a bit dull and I feel they have been done before. I kept waiting for the movie to get better but it never happened. There's nothing really innovative or great about this movie .Don't waste your money. Big bummer, even the little ones were bored in their seats. There are better things to watch on streaming at",negative
"This movie challenge my intellect. At first, I was lost to see what direction the film was taking, but then I got on board with the plot. I consider all the actors did an excellent job - even Chris Rock convinced me in his serious role.",positive
"Great movie, great cast and a very beautiful film.",positive
"Easily one of the best movies of its kind: action, history, heart. Characters to fall in love with superb portrayals.",positive
"I wanted to see it because of actors involved Robert DeNiro, Chris Rock, Christian Bale, etc but did not like the movie.",negative
"This movie is a subtle as a brick to the face. There is unmistakably an energy and chemistry among the three main talents of the film. Unfortunately Russell is trying to tell a story that, given the audience most likely to show up in the first place, feels very much like preaching to a choir. *I* don't need to be convinced of the themes of this film. Which wouldn't be terrible if there was any deftness or finesse or elegance to the plotting. There isn't. It's an onslaught of voice-over, flashbacks, expository dialogue, Things happen with little appropriate reaction from the characters. And then the story stops to explain the painfully obvious plot 'twist' that was absolutely nodded at a mere 6 minutes prior. This was not an enjoyable cinematic experience. It wasn't even eye-opening. Yeah, we know what is going on in the world. Some of us are in fact very much against it. This film is not going to open any fresh eyes to the darkness ahead. Merely make the ones that are open roll back in disbelief.",negative
"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ""ridiculous"". The first half of the film may be described as ""slow"" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.",positive
Painfully bad movie with an unbearably annoying and embarassingly unaware of himself main character.,negative

"This movie struck home for me. Being 29, I remember the '80's and my father working in a factory. I figured, if I worked hard too, if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own. I've noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere.<br /><br />I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. Ic an't find it anywhere! I'd love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas.",positive
"How this film could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really? What were the scriptwriters thinking? Was it just ignorance (""I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School"") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended? Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one!",negative
"Though I hadn't seen much of Billy Eichner as a comedian before, the fact that the trailers alone were actually really funny gave me a good feeling about this film would. And, thankfully, Bros is just as good as I hoped it would be. Not only does the writing manage a near perfect balance between hilariously self-aware and genuinely heartbreaking, but the film has two great lead performances to back it up. Some of the pacing can feel rushed and the movie does eventually fall victim to a lot of the cliches that it makes fun of, but the rest of the film is so well done, those flaws never bothered me. I had high exceptions for this film and wanted to get a few good laughs out of it, and it met my exception and gave me quite a few good laughs. Nuff said.",positive
"Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.",positive
"its a mess, its quirky mess. it does not have cool plot twists, it feels like the writers just started trying to expand on too many plot lines and we ended up without a single solid one. never recommending.",negative
"I honestly don't know what else you'd want or expect from a horror movie. Some first-rate performances, fine photography, some surprising story beats. Avoid the trailer and in-depth reviews.",positive
"A brilliantly constructed first hour that builds tension, has some perfectly acted uncomfortable moments, some great comedic bits that made me audibly giggle, and some absolutely beautiful cinematography. This movie does sadly turn into mush beyond that point though. The writing becomes sloppy, and some of the scenes are just unnecessary (including one of the most uncomfortable, unnecessary, and utterly unwanted scene that could have been completely cut out of the film with no problem). This movie does have some great scenes throughout but sadly they are not enough to forgive the rest of the mess that this movie creates.",negative
Good and refreshing. So many twists that make the movie an unique new piece to watch every halloween.,positive
"Having relatively high hopes for this film, especially with the cast but was let down by the plot. Could you consider this movie a thriller comedy because I would. The opening scene has you reeled in but kept getting taken back but unbelievably dumb decisions and poor story telling. It leaves you with a sour taste due to the fact it had so much potential.",negative
"Suprisingly, this doesn't feel like an Illumination movie with a 50-60 million dollar budget, feels like an enjoyment out of you're time. If you like hanging out with your family and spending your time with them, this movie is a must watch! Have nothing to say other then a enjoyable film!",positive
"In my opinion its Illuminations best movie, very short, wish it was longer. This movie is the definition of fun and I highly recommend it to anybody who like to laugh. 8/10",positive
Even as an adult this movie was a lot of fun I’m sure for a kid even that much more enjoyable some of the humor is a little bit more directed toward the older ages and might be over the top for little kids but from beginning to end it’s just a simple fun story good animation a lot of fun and worth the time spent to go see it,positive
This was brutally boring.,negative
"Entertaing family fun. Also a smiling Batman who is kids freindly I guess @Lolalambchops is happy about this movie, I know I will. Anyway good to see light hearted humor from DC. Very enjoyable good for wholesome fun",positive
"Dont listen to the critics, Its a solild 7/10 movie and personal favorite! give it a try its a blast! and re watchable too !",positive
"This is the worst movie ever .Good actors but the plot of the movie is boring, meaningless story.I am feeling so disappointed",negative
"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.",negative
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some ""gore"" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's ""sequel"" to AFTERMATH (now available as a ""double feature"" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don't care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future",negative
"This movie is an absolute GIFT FROM GOD. It is like I walked into heaven when this movie started playing. If you want to be happy, watch this movie. It will change your life.",positive
Loved this movie. Watched it with my family and we laughed so much.,positive
"I didn't know what it was about so the plot was a cool surprise. This was a modern take on the classic vampire genre so I enjoyed it but this doesn't make the movie good. It was below average, the acting was bad.",negative
This was really bad. Please save your time and money. Not worth the watch.,negative
One of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and the only reason for me to go back to cinemas,positive
The characters are so unlikeable I didn’t care what happened to them. I just wish it had happened faster.,negative
"It was really good, action but a good storyline overall",positive
"This movie was so bad. Worst movie i've ever seen. They rushed into thing, like common y'all were fucking on the 3rd day and making out on the 2nd day, like you guys just met.

I thought this movie was gonna be more similar to ready or not. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was even better,positive
"My wife & I both thought this was a very good movie; very well acted, and interesting engaging story",positive
I loved this movie. Both of the leads put in stellar performances. And it's so realistic. I had a family member like that that would get out and think they could have a little.,positive
"My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. (Our age in the 70""s) It was much better than I thought it would be. Just see the movie. I think you'll agree!",positive
Just did not like the way the story was told! It was slow too!,negative
"I came for a love story about history, small towns and lost loves, and because I like Kevin Klein. All I got was sanctimony and a one dimensional look at the sort of trauma that can lead to addiction. Going to rehab might mean that you are no longer an alcoholic, just a crashing bore filled with self-righteous pride at your will power. If you work really hard to eliminate the addiction, you solve some surface problems but the trauma remains. Our protagonist is a doormat with rotten children who ignores her own gifts. Characters are flat, selfish and one dimensional. Fourth wall is broken from the start because the writers can't show any depth or are lazy or maybe just incapable. Boo.",negative
"So dope. Art is my new favorite murderer. He loves what he does and he’s a cocky killer. Lots of grind house gore, laughs, plenty of wincing will ensue, and some new ways of ‘getting the job done’ compared to the old run of the mil slasher flicks. Go see it. Watch the first one first.",positive
"Damien really out did himself with this one. Exceeded all expectations, by far! The story, the special fx- everything was phenomenal. Any horror fanatic will adore this film.",positive
"aside from some confusion on the plot. man I had a great time watching this. I actually found myself scared. I jumped a few times and I find it hard to believe that they only spent 250,000 on the budget. my favorite aspect was the soundtrack editing and make up.",positive
Individual performances were fine but plot dragged and humor lagged.,negative
"This one improved upon the first in every conceivable way. the gore, the story, the characters, and Art the Clown himself.",positive
"Expected some laughs, there were none.",negative
It has some great jump scares and full on gore! I loved it!! Would definitely watch again and again!,positive
"This might be the worst movie I've seen in 20 years. Terribly written, the direction is abysmal. Kevin smith is out of touch with his fans. I've seen student films better than this. Kevin's Smith should be banned from Hollywood. Finally something for Kevin to cry about.",negative
Loved it. Just as good if not better than the first in everyway.,positive
"We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.",negative
Loved it! Total gorefest as per usual.,positive
Oh noes one of these attack of the Japanese ghost girl movies... i don't even remember how many i've seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... OK this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we'll let me tell you. there's a million of you =D this is one of them. 3/10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by NOT seeing this!,negative
"While small in scope, See How They Run is a rather delightful and fun whodunnit with a great cast and pretty well staged plot.",positive
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.<br /><br />I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.<br /><br />I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."" I'll give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their 'creation': Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.<br /><br />And for the record, I *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God.<br /><br />You know what? I'm not writing anymore about this. It's just too painful.",negative
"My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. So it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.<br /><br />Bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.",negative
"I forgot that I bought tickets to see this movie in the theater. I got them for my wife actually. So I'm giving it five stars because my fat ass got to stay home... We did end up watching about 10 minutes of it online. Then, she started crying, because she's so sentimental about these movies. So I guess that's a good thing...? The beginning is excellent though. They were playing hockey on the roof, but that's as much as I can tell you (if anyone even reads these). I hope to watch the rest of the movie one day. If so, I'll make revisions where necessary.",positive
Would not see a movie with Jane Fonda. She hates guys like me and I wouldn’t want to disappoint her by seeing her movie. Vietnam Veteran 1967.,negative
"Over-written, over-explained, complicated kids movie.",negative
"Plot is not too slow moving, lots of funny moments, likeable characters. Story is unique and not redundant of other stories we have seen before. Has a satisfying ending. Would like to see a sequel for it. My 9 year old daughter enjoyed it.",positive
The movie was really good. My 8 & 6 year olds both liked it also. They like how the cat was nice.,positive
"It was pretty okay lol. Not a lot going on as far as humor or excitement, but the kids enjoyed it. I wouldn’t pay to see it in the theater though. Not worth the money!",negative
I completely loved the show it was wonderful absolutely good for any ages and I'm 60 years old and I enjoyed myself thoroughly it was beautiful,positive
"It's a love story to books! I fell in love with the book and the movie does a wonderful job encapsulating all of its beauty and characterizations as much as possible in the limited movie time. A.J. Fikry becomes very lovable as the film progresses and so do all the characters that he attracts into his life: from baby Maya to the chief of police to the second love of his life.

You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. Lion's Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film, you would swear George W. Bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.<br /><br />Stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time.

I read the 5 star review from the Guardian and went with expectations. The first 10 minutes set expectations for something amazing. Then end result was pretentious and overlong with few insights and lots of repetition of footage already in the public domain. The only redeeming part was the insight into Bowie's move to Berlin and the creative process with Eno. The mission of this documentary project appears to have been to create an art statement rather than enlighten. I went with the kids to see this. My teenage son is a Bowie fan. I thought they would be blown away. All of us left the cinema silent with mixed feelings of disappointment and anger. Not to be spoken of or watched again.,negative

"Very chaotic film. I was on edge the entire time because no 2 scenes were consistent. David Bowie mentioned embracing chaos a few times in the film so I guess this is how he would have wanted it. His interviews were incomprehensible due to the loud background music added on top of the original audio. Definitely an editing blunder there. I had very little prior knowledge of Bowie and watched this to learn more about him and hear his creative process. Nothing has changed in that regard. He seemed like such a fascinating human being so I hope another film is made that is more of a legitimate biopic not a psychedelic, paranormal experience.",negative

"If you want an objective perspective, then watch the same title on YouTube which includes only interviews with the actual participants. The movie version was written by a Columbia alumni (wrote Dumb and Dumber) who is obviously a Communist sympathizer. Jane Fonda could have been an advisor. The hero of the movie is Chickie Donahue's sister who is a student at Columbia and an anti-war activist. The movie ends when he gives her a can of beer originally intended for Vietnam soldiers on the Columbia campus, and they hug. Russell Crowe plays a fat slob of a reporter who seemingly has carte blanche to wander onto U.S. Army bases at will and photograph everything. Watching this fat slob trying to run is hilarious. In the film, much of Chickie's experience is manipulated or fictitious (like watching a Viet Cong spy being thrown out of a helicopter) to show the United States in the worst light possible. Just a complete waste of time.",negative

"A mesmerizing insight to a brilliant artist. While I think the director could have cut out around 20 minutes and ended it more profoundly, I was actively engaged throughout. The Best : hearing that David Bowie loved his life and would do it all over again. This film goes beyond a documentary on the life of David Bowie, making the viewer want to strive for the same conclusion motivating one not to ultimately look back and wonder if your life could have been better. He created the life he wanted found the love he deserved; the dream we all want to live.",positive

This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. There's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. The whole thing is just laughable.,negative
"This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie. Do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! Buy the CD, if you must. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it is better then the movie.",negative

"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

"Supposedly a ""social commentary"" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's, ""Nightmare"" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised ""babe in prison"" movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of ""Gilligan's Island"") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade:",negative

"I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. It's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! Great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.",negative
This movie was very good. Beautiful cinematography. The story flowed wonderfully and the drama took me to tge edge. Wonderful acting all tge way round and I left feeling good.,positive
"What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico. Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. And you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word ""butthorn"" either. Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from ""Lethal Weapon"" and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in ""Red Dawn"" a few years earlier. After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies. Sadly he'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in ""Every Which Way You Can.""",negative
You just can’t expect to much from a movie with this kind of plot. Find ways the lion can kill a bunch of people but yet the main characters escape.

I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie, but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying",negative

"The box is why I originally picked up this movie and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been duped. I had thought this movie would be something like a Road Trip/Eurotrip/American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. It appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.",negative
"Didn't expect to be so won over by Zach. I turned this on with zero expectations and no interest in the short-format binge. I found myself locked into the story pretty quickly with a pile of laundry and a ""Shhh, if you want a snack you can grab whatever you can reach. Ice Cream? Sure…"" directed at my son. I'm absolutely the target demographic for these kinds of movies. Zach presents Chickie with so much earnestness and just the right amount of devil-may-care charm. Music was handled nicely throughout.",positive
"The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. I'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn't there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling ""Boo!"" All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house.

"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). Some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of Marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. Of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the Canary Islands, and other ""wow"" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.",negative

"erum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.",negative

"Well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it's not in this case). What else can I say about this...? The action, when happening, is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there's not much to recommend ""Kite"". Watch it if you want, but you're not missing much if you skip this one",negative
"This movie is stupid. There's no getting around it. But so is Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is significantly more funny than this.

Call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.",negative
"Gone is the wonderful campiness of the original. In place is a c-grade action no-brainer, wich is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original.

It is one of the best films in years and certainly the best film this year. It is modern arthouse in all the best senses.

By far the best movie in theaters for one!! 2nd I'm 31yrs old I'm adopted and I knew going into it that they filmed it at my old high school middle school. Also my son my wife and my mother in law were all extras I had the opportunity but for some reason chose not to. Seeing him at my school on the same floor I wrestled on walking the same halls I did and our story's are pretty close I even had a friend like he has in the movie!! I cried several times I didn't get to see the ending of it it was a school night and my son was ready to go it it was midnight. I would definitely pay to see this again and I don't say that about any movie idk this is just a amazing God filled movie it's amazing! I cannot wait to watch it again my wife said the same thing and this helped her realize what it's like!!it deserves %100 across the board!!!,positive

Absolutely one of the worst movies I have watched in recent memory. The story skips back and forth from psycho teen with psycho friends to psycho adult with hot fiancee. Who appears clueless to just how crazy Mila Kinis' character is. If I could give this no stars I would. I'm not sure exactly what the plot was beyond a horrific school shooting. Isn't that more of what we need to see? Go read a book...this movie is terrible.,negative
Another bad Mila Kunis movie,negative
"Really showed a side of adoption from the adopted, biological parents and adopted parents point of view. Extremely well done and a must see.",positive
"great emotional, heart felt story. .love seeing the real people in roles in the true story movie!",positive
"Very well paced, well acted. Good depiction of what can occur when a child is allowed to live rather than be aborted..",positive
"This movie was very moving. It takes a lot to get my husband emotional. He cried. It was very interesting to see the point of view of the adoptee, adopter and birth parents. Many women are judged because they make a decision to put up their child for adoption. They are selfless and are putting the needs of the child before their own. Thank God they chose adoption over killing their child.",positive
"TERRIBLE SCRIPT. Clunky, no meaningful character arcs, expositions were amateur, dialogue was phony, narrator overdone, and in general a mess. Those are just the facts, sir. As for my personal opinion, I think this movie is getting likes from people who have experienced #MeToo moments and so it resonates with them. That doesn't make it a good movie though.",negative
This movie was beyond awesome and best watch multiple times. There is so much going on with the easter eggs. I love every second of it!,positive
"The trailer looked interesting, sadly the film was not. Terrible from start to finish.",negative
I have no words to describe how fantastic this movie was.,positive
Usually when you see a higher user rating than a critic movie then you know it is a decent movie. This is not the case with this movie.,negative
This movie was better than people described it. It reminded me of a twilight zone episode.,positive
Worst movie I've seen since the Meg,negative
"Absolutely great, beautiful. Nothing more to add",positive
"Found it very boring, sorry!",negative
A family country western sci-fi. Absolutely loved it.,positive
Jordan Peele managed to bring another sensational movie! This director is the master of modern horror. He brought a new style of alien to theaters with an amazing story.,positive
The movie is to slow its just unbearable all actors are acting rly bad..,negative
dont see a point. just bored the whole time.,negative
Awful. Couldn't wait for it to be over,negative
Great example of how thriller movies should be. During the movie i was breathing heavily even though no horror elements were there! Truly a masterpiece,positive
worst movie i've ever seen. It is so damn corny and it is not entertaining or scary at all. It feels like i'm back in 6th grade and the teacher puts on a cheap movie for the pizza party.,negative
"Really good movie, left me speechless and trembling, the camera moves were really well played and catching. The plot was something that I wasn't expecting and made me dumbfounded, on my list of favorites for sure.",positive
"The screenplay and cinematography were great, but the unrealistic climbing sequences, the plot holes, the continuity errors and the really bad special effects made the movie very hard to watch.",negative
"Far from being anything committed with reality, the movie delivers a non-stop filling of anxiety and distress on an enternaining way. Worth watching.",positive
"Completely unrealistic and lazy production, like there's not even wind up there, and also no clibing knowledge whatsoever, they couldn't even Strap a backpack on their chests the intire movie.",negative
I'm afraid of heights so this movie hit me in a way that correctly scares me. I definitely recommend this movie!,positive

"This movie except for the cinematography that if you have any kind of fear of heights will make you a little queasy is all it has it going for it. The premise that experience climbers would attempt such a feat with nothing but a single rope as they’re climbing and safety gear is so far from believable it’s ridiculous. So many plot holes, so many stretches of the imagination that it can’t deliver on they should’ve done a solid favor and just not delivered the film to the theater to begin with.",negative

Entire storyline was hard to hollow and was just a bore,negative
"Far from being anything committed with reality, the movie delivers a non-stop filling of anxiety and distress on an enternaining way. Worth watching.",positive
"Good acting, interesting premise and held my attention. But ultimately disappointing. 25% longer than required, resulting in much repetition. Essentially, a theme in search of a plot.",negative
"his movie is an awesome piece of art! Reminds me of Goosebumps 2, it has that type of vibe in it. But, they could've done more animatronic attacking the kids and the movie is short.",positive
Movie was very confusing and kind of boring at times,negative
I think is movie is awesome. I love Spirit Halloween and this movie makes me nostalgic and remember past awesome years at spirit halloween! I absolutely love this movie!! I definitely recommend you watch it!,positive
Great kids movie for Halloween.,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by the Spirit Halloween movie. I went into the movie expecting something cheesy and low-quality, but the movie was entertaining, funny, and silly. I would call it a family-friendly future cult-classic. The only complaint I have is that there is a bit too much suspension of disbelief. Some things just worked out too well when there should have been more realism to it.",positive
"Pugh was good, but the movie is pretty vapid",negative
it's horrible how the critic says,negative
"This movie was a disaster. I'm not sure I've ever gone to a movie that was more disjointed. The movie lacks focus and fails to provide a good story plot line. The movie fails to have an ending that clarify what happens throughout the disjointed movie. I think the attempt was to make a over the top movie that just does not focus on the story or the plot. I do not recommend seeing this movie in the theater. I do not recommend paying for this movie on a streaming service, not sure if I would recommend watching it if it was free on TV when you're completely bored because it will not getting your attention for the whole time",negative
"This movie is so fun. Perfect halloween movie for little ones as it is not too scary, and pretty comical in some sections. Really puts you in the halloween spirit!",positive
That guy acting in the arguing scene was so bad,negative
the lead actress was annoying throughout the movie. Felt very dragged out and like the movie was just her crying with very little context until the end.,negative
Definitely a new cute family friendly Halloween movie.,positive
Loved it. Pretty good acting. Felt like I was locked in a Spirit Halloween store with them. Fun movie.,positive
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really enjoy movies that keep you guessing. This movie was like a story we have all heard before but the way Olivia told it and to inline with the 20th century ideologies I found to be a completely on point. Florence did amazing as one of the leads and I can't wait to see what Olivia makes next!!,positive
This movie sucked,negative
"I loved this film. It was not what I was expecting. I loved the surprise aspect of it. I did not care for the characters at the start, but as the story developed they really drew me in. I did not expect to love this film but I do.",
"Don't Worry Darling Is Just A Harry Styles Miscast. Although Pugh Shines in this film, this movie is just a mess.",negative
"Beautifully shot and acted, great audio too",positive
What a terrible movie! So so so boring,negative
"This movie was a really fun ride, it's well directed with a great cast. On top of that the cinematography, costumes, set design are all Oscar worthy. Olivia Wilde made the first Hollywood movie during Covid and despite multiple Covid shutdowns and running out of money, made a highly aesthetic, beautiful film.",positive
